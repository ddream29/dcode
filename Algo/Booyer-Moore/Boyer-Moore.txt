 Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

There can be at most one majority element which is more than ⌊n/2⌋ times.
There can be at most two majority elements which are more than ⌊n/3⌋ times.
There can be at most three majority elements which are more than ⌊n/4⌋ times.
and so on.

Knowing this can help us understand how we can keep track of majority elements which satisfies O(1)O(1) space requirement.
