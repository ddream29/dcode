Need to flip a Character or Number 
Defined max occurence of a Character or Number


         Define the value of k 
             
         Define Start point 
             
         Define End Point 
             
         Point both at 0th position
             
         1 0 0 1 1 0
         
         Start
         End
         
         For each iteration check if given value is defined Character or Number if yes then decrement the vale of k
             
         if at any point we find that k value is less than 0 that means we have exceded the limt 
         of flips or deletion 
             
         So we need to move the Start pointer to the a place where k is again back to zero
         and increment the vale of the both Start Pointer and K value
             
         Finaly Maximum value will be 
                     
         Max of max till now and length of substring between End and Start Index + 1 because we are finding the lengths
         
         
         
         int k;
         int start=0;
         int ans=0;
         
         for(int end=0;end<nums.length;end++)
         {
             if(nums[end]==Given char of number or condition)
             {
                 k--;
             }
             
             while(k<0)
             {
                 if(nums[start]==Given char of number or condition)
                 {
                     k++;
                 }
                 
                 start++;
             }
             
             ans=Math.max(ans,end-start+1);
         }
            
        return ans;
